* CHANGES BY SAM GOLOB   2005/02/02    VERSION 2.2              *
*                                                               *
* ALLOWED FOR SMP/E CHANGES FOR RECENT SYSTEM LEVELS (z/OS 1.5) *
*                                                               *
* A ++ASSIGN CARD ON THE TOP OF AN SMPPTFIN FILE USED TO THROW  *
* OFF THE SMPPTFIN FORMAT DETECTION.  NOW A FEW DIFFERENT SMP/E *
* CONTROL CARDS WILL INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF AN SMPPTFIN FILE, *
* BUT THEY WILL NOT CAUSE THE PRINT OF SYSMOD NUMBERS IN THE    *
* SYSPRNT2 DD NAME.  THESE DELIBERATELY DO NOT INCLUDE SUCH     *
* SMP/E CONTROL CARDS THAT WOULD NORMALLY OCCUR IN THE MIDDLE   *
* OF A PTF OR OTHER SYSMOD, SUCH AS:  ++MOD, ++MAC, ++SRC,      *
* ++MACUPD, ++SRCUPD, OR THE ++DATA TYPE OF CARDS.  ++JCLIN     *
* IS INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING LIST, EVEN THOUGH IT NORMALLY    *
* WOULD OCCUR WITHIN A PTF.  THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT IT IS  *
* POSSIBLE FOR A PURE ++JCLIN STREAM TO BE INPUTTED TO SMP/E,   *
* SO SUCH A FILE SHOULD BE MARKED AS THOUGH IT IS IN SMPPTFIN   *
* FORMAT, PROVIDED THAT A ++JCLIN CARD IS INSERTED AT THE TOP   *
* OF THE FILE.                                                  *
*                                                               *
*   LIST OF SUCH SUPPORTED SMP/E CONTROL CARDS CURRENTLY....    *
*  ++ ASSIGN                                                    *
*  ++ HOLD                                                      *
*  ++ RELEASE                                                   *
*  ++ FEATURE                                                   *
*  ++ PRODUCT                                                   *
*  ++ NULL                                                      *
*  ++ JCLIN                                                     *
*                                                               *
