Changes for June 2006 -- V2.4 -- Steve Myers

Added support for more than 9999 files to echo IBM support added
in z/OS 1.5.  For files greater than 9999, the format of FL1FILSQ
changes.  The first byte is an EBCDIC question mark (?) followed by
the file sequence number in 3 bytes as a binary value.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes backed out by Sam Golob - Mar 18, 2008 - V2.5

  Reason was that file numbers in SYSPRNT2 report were incorrectly
  reported.  S.Myers' changes need to be fixed and reinserted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from Sam Golob - Jan 23, 2019 - V2.5.1

  File numbers in the SYSPRNT2 report now appear to be correct.
  But the format of the report had to be altered, and therefore
  this version is being kept separate, as member TAPEMAPM.
