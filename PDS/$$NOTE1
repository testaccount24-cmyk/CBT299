Note:  S.Golob - Peter McFarland's changes have been merged into the
                 member TAPEMAP.  No extra member TAPEMAPF required.

The version of TAPEMAP called TAPEMAPF was modified by Peter McFarland
to take care of the case when the UCB extension is above the line, and
TAPEMAP hasn't taken the proper measures to get the sense materials.
Peter's solution is simply to skip the sense reporting, because at
those MVS levels where this is relevant, the JOBLOG reports the sense
values anyway.

Until we have a better solution than this kludge, I'm leaving Peter's
version out there (same as TAPEMAP, except skipping the sense reporting
under certain conditions) as member TAPEMAPF.  (SG-03/04)  The load
module library File 035 will also receive an extra member TAPEMAPF, for
those who don't have time to assemble and link.
